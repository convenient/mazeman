---------------------------------------------------------------------

I want say thanks, to all the people on #gp32dev, who will always
help me solving bugs.

The chatboard is a Jouni Korhonen production, so if you like this
thing, give him a big kiss :)

Some of the Sound calculating samplerates functions are from 
Jouni Korhonen, so if you like perfect sampled sound, you now
know why its perfect   :)
